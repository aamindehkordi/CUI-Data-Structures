# Projects

This parent directory contains three different projects completed as capstones for a trimester of the class: AuthorCheck, Degrees of Separation Console Application, and MazeSolver. Below is a brief summary of each project.

## [AuthorCheck](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/AuthorCheck_student)

AuthorCheck is a console application designed to compare two documents (Doc1 and Doc2) and count the unique words in each document. It supports command-line options and uses either a linked list or binary tree data structure for word storage and comparison. The program includes error handling, input validation, and file reading and filtering.

## [Degrees of Separation](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/DegreesBetween)

This C# console application finds the shortest path between two actors using the concept of "degrees of separation". It consists of two main parts: the GraphLibrary, which provides a graph data structure, and the KevinBaconGame, which uses the graph to find the shortest path between two actors. The application demonstrates the use of graph data structures and algorithms (such as breadth-first search) to solve real-world problems.

## [MazeSolver](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/MazeSolver_student)

MazeSolver is a C# program that uses a maze-solving agent named "Franc" to navigate and solve mazes. The program provides a framework for generating random mazes or loading custom mazes from external files. Franc, the maze-solving agent, explores the maze and makes decisions based on its surroundings to find the optimal path to the maze's finish point. The agent uses a combination of path exploration and backtracking algorithms to efficiently solve the maze.
