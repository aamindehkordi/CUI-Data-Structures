# CUI-Data-Structures

This repository contains projects and homework assignments from the Data Structures course at Concordia University Irvine (CUI).

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

1. [Homework](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework): This directory contains homework assignments from the course. Each subdirectory represents a different assignment, and contains the relevant code files.

2. [Projects](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects): This directory contains larger projects from the course. Each subdirectory represents a different project, and contains the relevant code files.

## Homework

The Homework directory contains several subdirectories, each representing a different homework assignment. Below is a brief description of each homework assignment based on the available information:

1. [Homework 0 - Circle](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/0): This homework assignment involves creating and manipulating Circle objects. It includes a main program and a library that defines the Circle class.

2. [Homework 1 - Counter](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/1): This homework assignment demonstrates the use of a Counter object. It includes a main program that creates a Counter object, increments it, and displays its tally.

3. [Homework 2 - LinkedList](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/2): This homework assignment involves creating and manipulating a LinkedList. It includes a main program and a library that defines the LinkedList class.

4. [Assignment 4 - Linked List](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/4%20-%20Linked%20List): This assignment involves the implementation and use of linked lists.

5. [Assignment 5 - ListSymbolTable](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/5%20-%20ListSymbolTable): This assignment involves the implementation and use of symbol tables.

## Projects

This directory contains the main projects completed during the course. Each subdirectory represents a different project, and contains the relevant code files and resources. The projects cover various topics in data structures, and often involve the implementation and use of complex data structures and algorithms. The Projects directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

- [AuthorCheck_student](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/AuthorCheck_student): This project involves ...
- [DegreesBetween](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/DegreesBetween): This project involves ...
- [MazeSolver_student](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/MazeSolver_student): This project involves the implementation and use of a maze solver algorithm.
