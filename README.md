# CUI-Data-Structures

This repository contains projects and homework assignments from the Data Structures course at Concordia University Irvine (CUI).

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

1. [Homework](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework): This directory contains homework assignments from the course. Each subdirectory represents a different assignment, and contains the relevant code files.

2. [Projects](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects): This directory contains larger projects from the course. Each subdirectory represents a different project, and contains the relevant code files.

## Homework

The Homework directory contains several subdirectories, each representing a different homework assignment. Below is a brief description of each homework assignment based on the available information:

1. [Homework 0 - Circle](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/0): This homework assignment involves creating and manipulating Circle objects. It includes a main program and a library that defines the Circle class.

2. [Homework 1 - Counter](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/1): This homework assignment demonstrates the use of a Counter object. It includes a main program that creates a Counter object, increments it, and displays its tally.

3. [Homework 2 - LinkedList](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/2): This homework assignment involves creating and manipulating a LinkedList. It includes a main program and a library that defines the LinkedList class.

4. [Assignment 4 - Linked List](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/4%20-%20Linked%20List): This assignment involves the implementation and use of linked lists.

5. [Assignment 5 - ListSymbolTable](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Homework/5%20-%20ListSymbolTable): This assignment involves the implementation and use of symbol tables.

## Projects

This directory contains the main projects completed during the course. Each subdirectory represents a different project, and contains the relevant code files and resources. The projects cover various topics in data structures, and often involve the implementation and use of complex data structures and algorithms. The Projects directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

- [AuthorCheck_student](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/AuthorCheck_student): This project involves comparing two documents and counting the unique words in each document. It supports command-line options and uses either a linked list or binary tree data structure for word storage and comparison. The program includes error handling, input validation, and file reading and filtering.

- [DegreesBetween](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/DegreesBetween): This C# console application finds the shortest path between two actors using the concept of "degrees of separation". It consists of two main parts: the GraphLibrary, which provides a graph data structure, and the KevinBaconGame, which uses the graph to find the shortest path between two actors. The application demonstrates the use of graph data structures and algorithms (such as breadth-first search) to solve real-world problems.

- [MazeSolver_student](https://github.com/aamindehkordi/CUI-Data-Structures/tree/main/Projects/MazeSolver_student): This project involves a maze-solving agent named "Franc" that navigates and solves mazes. The program provides a framework for generating random mazes or loading custom mazes from external files. Franc, the maze-solving agent, explores the maze and makes decisions based on its surroundings to find the optimal path to the maze's finish point. The agent uses a combination of path exploration and backtracking algorithms to efficiently solve the maze.
